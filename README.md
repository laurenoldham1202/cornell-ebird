# Yellow-bellied Sapsucker Abundance in Michigan

[View project here!](https://laurenoldham1202.github.io/cornell-ebird/)

This interactive map displays the weekly abundance of Yellow-bellied Sapsucker birds in Michigan from 2018. According to eBird Status and Trends, _relative abundance_ is defined as:

> ...the expected count on an eBird Traveling Count starting at the optimal time of day with the optimal search duration and distance that maximizes detection of that species in a region on the specified date.


Hexbins were created with QGIS. Example data pulled from ebirdst R package. Statistics generated in R with SpatialEco package. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.4 in December 2020.

Cool update! I was hired by Cornell Lab of Ornithology in January 2021 and helped overhaul the static status and trends maps into a comprehensive, interactive dashboard for more than 2900 bird species.
